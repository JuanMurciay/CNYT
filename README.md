# Project Title

complex numbers library

## Getting Started

This program is dedicated to calculating complex numbers with the help of a library and some complex numbers operated by the program

### Prerequisites

The requirements for this program are simply the complex numbers to operate.

### Installing
To develop this program it is necessary to know complex numbers and how to operate between them. Once we have this knowledge, we simply apply it with programming in Python.

## Running the tests

The tests are executed by creating some random complex numbers and with this the operation begins to run.

### Break down into end to end tests

To do these tests, they are divided into operations of complex numbers, that is, there are additions, subtractions, divisions, etc.

### And coding style tests

The tests justify the operations of complex numbers

## Deployment

In the real world when we want to know the result of a complex number we can use this program
